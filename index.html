    <h1>Getting to know Khalid</h1>
    <p>I come from humble beginnings and was raised right here in Detroit. I love to explore the city to find new places to eat and hang.<br /> 
        I graduated college in 2013 from Lake Superior State University where I played basketball. <br />
        I started at Oakland University playing basketball and running track. I am still fast. I may or may not have lost a step.<br /> 
        I love playing basketball, watching movies and spending time with my girlfriend.<br />
         I am 28, I have no kids and a random fact? Iâ€™m really good at beer pong. This is the introduction to my world, welcome!</p>
